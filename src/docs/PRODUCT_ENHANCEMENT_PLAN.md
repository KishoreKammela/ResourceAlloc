# ResourceAllocation: Product Enhancement & Implementation Plan

This document outlines the strategic enhancements for the ResourceAllocation platform, based on user feedback from the MVP. It serves as the primary roadmap for the next phase of development, focusing on building an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant SaaS application.

---

## 1. Core Architectural Enhancements

The platform will be evolved to support a more sophisticated multi-tenant architecture with richer data models.

### Enhanced Data Hierarchy

- **Platform Level**: Global `Platform Users` will manage the entire SaaS ecosystem.
- **Company Level**: Each `Customer Company` will be a distinct tenant with its own set of `Team Members`, `Resources`, `Clients`, `Projects`, and `Allocations`.
- **Core Entities**: The data models for all core entities will be significantly expanded to include detailed analytics, financial, operational, and performance data.

### Key Implementation Focus

- **`Allocations` as a Core Entity**: We will build out a dedicated `allocations` collection to act as the central link between `Resources` and `Projects`. This will enable advanced features like conflict management, detailed performance tracking, and granular financial analysis.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A more sophisticated RBAC system will be implemented for `Team Members`, allowing for granular permissions and access levels (e.g., company-wide, client-specific, project-specific).

## 2. Phased Implementation Plan

Development will proceed in logical phases, prioritizing foundational setup before moving to operational features.

### Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Data & Core UI)

1.  **Company Profile Enhancement**: Update the company registration and management UI to capture the new, detailed business intelligence and operational data.
2.  **Resource Management Overhaul**:
    - Implement a multi-step wizard for adding/editing `Resources` to handle the comprehensive new data fields (skills, experience, financial, availability).
    - Redesign the resource profile page to display this rich information clearly.
    - Enhance the AI-powered resume parsing to populate these new fields automatically.
3.  **Team Member & RBAC Implementation**:
    - Develop a "Team Management" section for Admins.
    - Implement the UI for inviting new team members and assigning them specific roles (`Project Manager`, `HR Manager`, etc.).
    - Lay the groundwork for the permission system based on these roles.

### Phase 2: Business Structure & Operations

4.  **Client Relationship Management (CRM) Enhancement**:
    - Update the client creation and editing forms to include the new CRM-like fields (relationship status, health scores, commercial info).
    - Design a client dashboard to track interactions, contracts, and financial performance.
5.  **Comprehensive Project Management**:
    - Enhance the project creation and editing UI to manage detailed information like budgets, timelines, milestones, and methodology.
    - Develop a project dashboard to visualize status, health, and key metrics.

### Phase 3: Advanced Operations & Intelligence

6.  **Advanced Resource Allocation UI**:
    - Build the core "Allocation" feature, allowing managers to formally assign resources to projects.
    - Develop a visual allocation board or calendar to manage resource capacity.
    - Implement initial conflict detection for over-allocated resources.
7.  **Analytics & Reporting**:
    - Create the initial version of the executive dashboard, focusing on key KPIs for resources, projects, and clients.
    - Implement the first set of financial and performance reports.

## 3. Detailed User Journey (Target State)

This outlines the target user experience we are building towards.

1.  **Onboarding**: A new `Super Admin` signs up, completes an enhanced, multi-step company profile wizard, selects a subscription plan, and is guided to invite their first team members.
2.  **Building the Talent Pool**: An `HR Manager` or `Admin` adds `Resources` to the platform. They use the AI-powered resume upload to auto-populate the detailed resource profiles, including skills, experience, and certifications.
3.  **Managing Business Relationships**: An `Account Manager` adds a new `Client`, filling out detailed CRM information and tracking the relationship health and contract status.
4.  **Defining Work**: A `Project Manager` creates a new `Project` for a client, defining its scope, budget, timeline, required roles, and technical stack in detail.
5.  **Allocating Talent**: The `Project Manager` then moves to the `Allocation` module. They see a forecast of required roles for the project and can either use the AI's suggestions or manually browse available `Resources`. They assign resources to the project for specific timeframes and at specific billing rates. The system flags any potential over-allocations.
6.  **Monitoring & Insights**: A `Super Admin` or `Executive` views the main `Dashboard` to get a real-time overview of resource utilization, project profitability, and client satisfaction scores, making data-driven strategic decisions.
