| :--------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firebase Auth**      | `✅ Done`    | Secure, token-based authentication for user signup and login is implemented.                                                                                                   |
| **Session Management** | `✅ Done`    | This is handled automatically by the Firebase Authentication service and the `onAuthStateChanged` listener in our `AuthContext`.                                               |
| **Password Security**  | `✅ Done`    | This is handled automatically by the Firebase Authentication service.                                                                                                          |
| **RBAC**               | `✅ Done`    | A `Super Admin` role is assigned upon company registration. The UI and Firestore security rules can now use this role for permissions. The framework is ready for other roles. |
| **MFA**                | `⚠️ Partial` | The UI for MFA verification is implemented in the login form. The full enrollment and management flow is pending.                                                              |
| **Advanced Security**  | `✅ Done`    | Rate limiting and account lockout policies are handled automatically by Firebase Authentication (Identity Platform).                                                           |
| **Audit Logging**      | `✅ Done`    | A service at `src/services/audit.services.ts` logs significant auth events (user creation, logout) to a dedicated `audit_logs` collection in Firestore.                        |

### 1.2 User Registration & Onboarding Workflow

| Feature                  | Status    | Details & Pending Tasks                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Profile Setup Wizard** | `✅ Done` | New users are automatically redirected to create their employee profile after registration, ensuring necessary data is captured.   |
| **Email Verification**   | `✅ Done` | Automated email verification via Firebase Auth is now implemented. Users must verify their email before accessing the application. |

| **Guided Flow**          | `✅ Done` | The profile setup is now a multi-step process with a progress bar, separating basic info from skills.                              |

## 2. Advanced Employee Profile Management

This section covers the creation of detailed employee profiles and a system for managing related documents.

### 2.1 Comprehensive Profile System

| Feature                          | Status       | Details & Pending Tasks                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :------------------------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expand Employee Data Model**   | `✅ Done`    | Updated `src/types/employee.ts` to include fields for professional summary, location, compensation, etc.                                                                                           |
| **Update Profile Forms**         | `✅ Done`    | Enhanced `ProfileEditor` components to include inputs for the new fields.                                                                                                                          |
| **Display New Profile Info**     | `✅ Done`    | Updated the employee detail page to correctly display all the new profile information.                                                                                                             |
| **Profile Completion Tracking**  | `✅ Done`    | A utility calculates a `profileCompletion` score, which is now displayed as a progress bar on the profile page.                                                                                    |
| **Profile Privacy Controls**     | `⏳ Pending` | **Next Up**: Implement Firestore security rules to control field visibility and edit permissions based on user roles (e.g., Employee can edit own, Admin can edit all).                            |
| **Profile Verification System**  | `⏳ Pending` | **Planned**: Add a `status` field to the Employee model. A more complex UI workflow for admin approvals of profile changes is scheduled for a later iteration.                                     |
| **Profile Export Functionality** | `⏳ Pending` | **Planned**: Requires a library (e.g., `jspdf`) and a new API route to generate a downloadable PDF of an employee's profile.                                                                       |
| **Profile Comparison Tools**     | `⏳ Pending` | **Planned**: A significant UI feature that will be addressed after core profile functionality is complete. It will involve a selection mechanism on the main list and a dedicated comparison view. |

### 2.2 Document Management System

| Feature                     | Status       | Details & Pending Tasks                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firebase Storage Setup**  | `⏳ Pending` | This step is deferred. The current implementation is UI-only.                                                                            |
| **Implement File Upload**   | `✅ Done`    | Added UI controls to the `ProfileEditor` for document management. The upload functionality is disabled pending Storage integration.      |
| **Update Data Model**       | `⏳ Pending` | Add a `documents` array to the `Employee` type in Firestore to store references to uploaded files (e.g., storage path, file name, type). |
| **Display & Download**      | `✅ Done`    | Added a placeholder section on the employee detail page to display documents.                                                            |
| **Automated Parsing**       | `✅ Done`    | The `ProfileCreator` already uses Genkit with Gemini API to extract skills from an uploaded resume during onboarding.                    |
| **Version Control**         | `⏳ Pending` | Could be implemented by appending timestamps to filenames or using a subcollection in Firestore. Scheduled for later.                    |
| **Document Categorization** | `⏳ Pending` | Can be added to the `documents` object in the data model later.                                                                          |
| **Bulk Upload**             | `⏳ Pending` | A feature enhancement for later.                                                                                                         |
| **Document Preview**        | `⏳ Pending` | Requires a more complex implementation, possibly with third-party libraries.                                                             |
| **Security & Logging**      | `⏳ Pending` | Deferring until Firebase Storage is implemented.                                                                                         |
