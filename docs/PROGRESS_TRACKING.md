| **Firebase Auth**      | `✅ Done`    | Secure, token-based authentication for user signup and login is implemented.                                                                                                   |
| **Session Management** | `✅ Done`    | This is handled automatically by the Firebase Authentication service and the `onAuthStateChanged` listener in our `AuthContext`.                                               |
| **Password Security**  | `✅ Done`    | This is handled automatically by the Firebase Authentication service.                                                                                                          |

| **Audit Logging**      | `✅ Done`    | A service at `src/services/audit.services.ts` logs significant auth events (user creation, logout) to a dedicated `audit_logs` collection in Firestore.                        |
