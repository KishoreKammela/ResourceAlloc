### 1.1 Multi-Role Authentication & Authorization

| Feature                | Status       | Details & Pending Tasks                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firebase Auth**      | `✅ Done`    | Secure, token-based authentication for user signup and login is implemented.                                                                                                   |
| **Session Management** | `✅ Done`    | This is handled automatically by the Firebase Authentication service and the `onAuthStateChanged` listener in our `AuthContext`.                                               |
| **Password Security**  | `✅ Done`    | This is handled automatically by the Firebase Authentication service.                                                                                                          |
| **RBAC**               | `✅ Done`    | A `Super Admin` role is assigned upon company registration. The UI and Firestore security rules can now use this role for permissions. The framework is ready for other roles. |
| **MFA**                | `❌ Pending` | Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via Firebase Auth for enhanced security. This can be an optional setting for users.                                                |
| **Advanced Security**  | `✅ Done`    | Rate limiting and account lockout policies are handled automatically by Firebase Authentication (Identity Platform).                                                           |
| **Audit Logging**      | `✅ Done`    | A service at `src/services/audit.services.ts` logs significant auth events (user creation, logout) to a dedicated `audit_logs` collection in Firestore.                        |

### 1.2 User Registration & Onboarding Workflow

| Feature                  | Status       | Details & Pending Tasks                                                                                                                                                      |
| :----------------------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Guided Registration**  | `✅ Done`    | A multi-step company registration form has been implemented, which creates a new company and assigns a `Super Admin`.                                                        |
| **Profile Setup Wizard** | `✅ Done`    | New users are automatically redirected to create their employee profile after registration, ensuring necessary data is captured.                                             |
| **Email Verification**   | `✅ Done`    | Automated email verification via Firebase Auth is now implemented. Users must verify their email before accessing the application.                                           |
| **Welcome Dashboard**    | `✅ Done`    | A welcome modal appears for new users after they complete their profile, guiding them on next steps.                                                                         |
| **Onboarding Analytics** | `✅ Done`    | A field `onboardingCompleted: true` is set on the user's profile in Firestore once they finish the setup wizard and view the welcome modal. This allows for simple tracking. |
| **Guided Flow**          | `❌ Pending` | Enhance the "Profile Setup Wizard" into a multi-step process with a progress bar (e.g., Step 1: Basic Info, Step 2: Skills, Step 3: Resume).                                 |
