| Feature                | Status       | Details & Pending Tasks                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firebase Auth**      | `✅ Done`    | Secure, token-based authentication for user signup and login is implemented.                                                                                                                             |
| **Session Management** | `✅ Done`    | Secure, HTTP-only session cookies are being used with a 5-day expiration, handled by our dedicated API routes.                                                                                           |
| **Password Security**  | `✅ Done`    | This is handled automatically by the Firebase Authentication service.                                                                                                                                    |
| **RBAC**               | `✅ Done`    | Core framework is complete. We have a `users` collection storing roles, and both the UI and Firestore security rules are enforcing permissions for `Super Admin`, `Admin`, and `Employee` roles.         |
| **MFA**                | `❌ Pending` | Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via Firebase Auth for enhanced security. This can be an optional setting for users.                                                                          |
| **Advanced Security**  | `❌ Pending` | Implement more specific Firebase Security Rules for rate limiting and investigate account lockout policies within Firebase Auth.                                                                         |
| **Audit Logging**      | `❌ Pending` | Create a Firebase Function triggered by auth events (e.g., `onCreate`, `onDelete`) to log significant authentication activities to a dedicated `audit_logs` collection in Firestore for security review. |

### 1.2 User Registration & Onboarding Workflow

| Feature                  | Status       | Details & Pending Tasks                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :----------------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email Verification**   | `✅ Done`    | New users are required to verify their email address before they can access the application dashboard. A dedicated page guides them through this process.                                 |
| **Profile Setup Wizard** | `✅ Done`    | The core workflow is in place. New employees are automatically redirected to a profile creation page after verifying their email, ensuring all necessary data is captured.                |
| **Guided Flow**          | `❌ Pending` | Enhance the "Profile Setup Wizard" into a multi-step process with a progress bar (e.g., Step 1: Basic Info, Step 2: Skills, Step 3: Resume).                                              |
| **Welcome Dashboard**    | `❌ Pending` | Create a simple, role-specific welcome modal or screen that appears the first time a user logs into the dashboard after completing onboarding.                                            |
| **Onboarding Analytics** | `❌ Pending` | Add a field like `onboardingCompleted: true` to the user's profile in Firestore once they finish the setup wizard. This will allow for simple tracking and analytics on completion rates. |
